# Semantic-model change log

Post-build changes to the AtScale semantic models in
[AtScaleInc/bird-atscale-models](https://github.com/AtScaleInc/bird-atscale-models),
one section per model. Record the kind of change and why; name the Workarounds
row when a change works around a tracked defect.

## Workarounds

Engine/tool defects the models deliberately work around. Check whether a row
still applies before carrying its workaround into a new model.

| ID | Defect | Workaround | Still applies? |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-02 | Derived-dataset SQL executes without the connection's schema on the `search_path`; bare table references deploy clean then fail every query with `relation does not exist`. | Schema-qualify every table reference in derived SQL (`public.<table>` for all BIRD connections). | Yes - applied in `cybermarket_pattern` (2026-08-10). Not re-tested against a fixed build. |
| Q-17 | Two deployed models sharing a name render corrupted metadata. | Keep deployed model names unique across the engine; do not publish the same catalog to two schemas. | Yes. |
| Q-17b | **A published model is materialised as a real relation by a non-idempotent code path.** `get_model_document` triggers `CREATE TABLE "<catalog_schema>"."<Model Name>"` with no `IF NOT EXISTS` and no preceding drop, so once that relation exists from an earlier publish every metadata call dies with `relation "<Model>" already exists`. **The failure is asymmetric, which is the dangerous part:** `list_models`, `explore_columns` and `focus_columns` hard-fail while `run_query` catches the error, skips path validation and returns CORRECT results - so the deploy looks healthy while the agent is blind. Neither redeploying nor restarting the MCP server clears it. | Drop the stale materialised relations in the catalog schema inside the engine's SQL store; republishing alone does not. Before any run, gate on `list_models` succeeding AND returning the expected model count - a working `run_query` is NOT evidence the catalog is healthy. | Yes - 2026-08-10/11. Voided three atscale runs (every task 0.000, 81-84% of tool calls erroring). `scripts/summarize_runs.py` flags such runs SUSPECT and excludes them. |
| MDX-Median | `Median()` is rejected at deploy as a `metric_calc`; must be `calculation_method: percentile` with `named_quantiles`. On the Postgres dialect the percentile sketch is then rejected at query time. Percentile metrics are exposed as `<name>_instance_<q>`; metadata is cached until `list_models force_refresh`. | Ship the percentile form anyway and record the dialect limitation. | Yes, where a KB definition needs a median. |
| D-01 | The engine re-parses and re-emits derived-dataset SQL, and a `'|'` string literal does not survive the round trip: every query touching the dataset fails with a raw warehouse `syntax error at or near "'|'"`. Other literals (`'$'`, `','`, `' km'`, `'Yes'`) round-trip fine. Validation and deploy both pass - it only surfaces on a live query. | Never use `|` in derived SQL. For a composite key use a compound SML leaf key rather than concatenating a surrogate. | Yes - found and fixed in `cybermarket_pattern` 2026-08-10. |
| E-01 | Bare `COUNT(<dimension attribute>)` is not evaluated: the engine drops the aggregate and returns the attribute's members. Re-confirmed live 2026-08-12. `COUNT(DISTINCT <attr>)` and a count measure are both correct. | Every identifier attribute's description must name the model's count measure and `COUNT(DISTINCT <attr>)`, and state that plain `COUNT` returns members rather than a number. | Yes - applied to `archeology_scan` Site Code (M-14) and `exchange_traded_funds` Fund. Carry into every new model's key attributes. |
| Q-15 | `COUNT(DISTINCT <dim>)` - the one form E-01 says to trust - is itself unreliable in three ways: it returns **null** under some measure predicates; it returns the **unfiltered** count under others (the predicate degrades to "joins to any fact"); and when **co-projected** with a plain `COUNT(<dim>)` the whole query drops to the dimension's grain and the distinct count collapses to 1 per row. Alone and unfiltered it is correct. | Run the DISTINCT form alone, never beside a plain `COUNT`, and never trust it under a measure filter - wrap the filter in a derived table instead. | Yes - engine fix open. |
| Q-20 | **A whole-population value cannot be shown beside detail rows by any obvious means, and three of the four failures are silent.** A scalar subquery in the SELECT list alongside detail rows returns each row's OWN value (a share measure came back 1.0 per row instead of 0.9397); `COUNT(m) OVER ()` likewise returns the row's own value; a `UNION ALL` totals row returns ZERO rows; `AVG(m) OVER ()` and a comma cross-join at least error. | `JOIN (SELECT <aggregate measure> AS total FROM <model> WHERE <population>) s ON 1=1` — confirmed live to repeat the true population value on every row. The scalar-subquery form stays correct only when the SELECT has no per-row grain. This buys a repeated COLUMN; where the answer needs a summary ROW (tracker B-04) the only route stays the FROM-less literal-values form. | Yes - found 2026-08-12 on ETF `_11` and `_12`. |
| Q-21 | A bare SQL stat function (`MIN`/`MAX`/`AVG`) over a measure in a flat SELECT dies in query planning with `ExpandStatFunctions: assertion failed: We already handled attribute values`. | Force the natural row grain in an inner derived table, then aggregate outside it. Window aggregates are not an escape - `AVG(m) OVER ()` raises the same error. | Yes - 2026-08-12. |
| Catalog-suffix | Deploying from Design Center appends the git branch to the catalog name (`_main`); `sml-cli atscale-deploy` uses the catalog name verbatim. The two paths publish to different schemas. | Read the schema back from `list_models` after any redeploy and make `config/environment_backends.yaml` match. | Yes - all models are published at `bird_atscale_models_catalog_main`. |

## cybermarket_pattern

**2026-08-10 - initial build.** Generated by `cybermarket_pattern/generator/`.
304 objects: 8 derived datasets, 7 dimensions, 178 metrics, 10 `metric_calc`s,
1 model.

Build decisions worth carrying to other models:

- **One wide transaction fact.** Six source tables are exactly 1:1 on the
  transaction key (1000 rows each, no orphans, verified live). Joining them into
  one fact gives every transaction-grain attribute a direct relationship to
  Platform / Vendor / Buyer / Product Listing, removing the conformance failure
  class where a measure on one fact cannot be sliced by a dimension from another.
- **Derived datasets throughout.** The source stores numbers as unit-suffixed or
  currency-formatted text (`'$98.60 '`, `'2140.32 km'`) and packs most attributes
  into `jsonb`. Parsing happens in the dataset SQL.
- **Recorded columns are not the KB formulas.** Verified live: 0 of 994 vendors
  have `RegStandeff` equal to the computed CEI; same for WTR and THR. Shipped as
  separate `Recorded` measures whose descriptions state they are different
  quantities.
- **Live data beats the metadata files** where they disagree - four columns
  documented as small categorical sets are continuous numerics live. Descriptions
  state the live reality and name the metadata's claim.
- **Multi-condition concepts precomputed** as Yes/No attributes (High Risk Vendor,
  Secure Platform, Premium Authentication, ...). Each raw component's description
  says it is an *input* and redirects filtering to the flag - otherwise a question
  phrased in a component's words gets filtered on that component alone and loses
  the other OR branch (240 or 146 vendors instead of 345).
- **Deliberate omissions where the KB states no threshold.** Suspicious Buyer,
  Traceable Communication and Escrow Compliance are defined qualitatively with no
  cut-off and their ambiguity entries are `is_mask: true`. No flag ships; the
  component measures are exposed instead.
- **Bucketed tiers are labelled as this model's convention** where the KB names
  tiers but the source stores no such labels.
- **RANK / DENSE_RANK twins** ship for every ranked quantity, each naming its twin
  and the reading it answers. Ties are real (17 threads share the max keyword
  count). Ranks are over the whole population, not a query's filtered subset.
- **Formula families.** Each KB formula ships as a per-entity average, a
  `Group Formula` recomputing the definition from aggregated components, a
  `Single <Entity> Value`, every component as its own measure, and exactly one
  support-set count (the intersection where all components are present). The
  group/average divergence is material - BRDR is 0.0479 pooled vs 0.0942 as a mean
  of per-buyer ratios.
- **`unrelated_dimensions_handling: error`** on every metric, so a non-conforming
  pairing fails loudly instead of returning empty.
- **No time dimension** - each entity appears once in its source table, so the
  "ever vs as-of-latest" distinction does not arise. History-wide flags are named
  "ever".

**Acceptance - all four gates pass** (after redeploying the D-01 fix). Exactness
25/25 exact-equal against source, Conformance 15/15, Discoverability 14/14,
Coverage 6/6. Group-vs-average separation verified on all nine ratio formulas,
diverging 1.43x to 4.09x. `unrelated_dimensions_handling: error` confirmed
refusing a non-conforming pairing before execution, at no warehouse cost.

Two gotchas worth carrying:

- **Re-verification.** Source columns declared `real` (float4) must be re-checked
  with `::float8`, not `::numeric`. The engine casts `real -> FLOAT8` and preserves
  the binary value; `::numeric` rounds to shortest round-trip decimal and produces
  a spurious 8th-digit mismatch. Caused a false alarm on ACI and THR.
- **Rank twins.** `SSD Rank Descending <= 10` returns 11 rows because two threads
  tie at position 10 - the RANK reading of "top N", which is why the DENSE_RANK
  twin ships beside it.

## archeology_scan

**2026-08-11 - initial build from `create_bird_model_prompt.v2.md`, prompt-only.**
Full rationale, exclusions and evidence in the model folder's `SPEC.md`.
Published at `bird_atscale_models_catalog_main`.

Shape: 4 fact grains - `scan_fact` (1000), `site_equipment_fact` (1000, carrying
998 real records plus spine rows), `site_quality_fact` (900),
`conservation_fact` (455). Site is the only dimension reaching all four.
94 metrics, 10 calculations, 123 queryable attributes.

**Acceptance - all four gates pass.** Every exactness probe exact-equal to source
to 12 decimals (counts 1000/900/905/900, total points 35,850,368,904, support
sets, per-site SQS and SCE, ranks, risk-zone split 778/122, a four-fact
cross-fact aggregate). Conformance: every dimension reaches its facts, and a
non-conforming pairing is refused before execution. Discoverability probed with
`amb_user_query` wordings only. Coverage: all six shapes.

### Findings worth carrying to other databases

- **`count(*)` in a dry run does not evaluate the select list.** Postgres
  optimises the projection away, so a division-by-zero in a computed column
  survives to query time. Counting `md5(row::text)` instead surfaced two
  (4 of 944 scanners record 0% battery; ESI can approach -10). Both denominators
  now use `NULLIF`.
- **Engine MDX function set**, probed with `validate_mdx_expression`: `SQRT`,
  `ABS`, `LOG10`, `EXP` supported; **`POWER` is not**. So `x^2` and `x^1.5` are
  rewritable as `x*x` and `x*SQRT(x)`, but `x^0.3` is not. Probe before declaring
  a group-level formula inexpressible.
- **A dangling-cross-reference check keyed on `Name (ACRONYM)` is not enough.** It
  matches the published base name and stops, so a description can promise a
  `(Recomputed For Group)` twin that was never shipped. A qualifier-aware check
  caught two more left stale by a rename whose phrase spanned a line break.
- **The build-time discoverability gate caught missing OBJECTS, not just missing
  wordings** - the model had no Registration ID and no Scan Timestamp at all, both
  asked for by name. Treat a failing phrase as a possible modelling gap first.
- **The dialect cannot express quartiles (Q-19).** `NTILE` is rejected outright
  ("Don't understand function: ntile") while `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK` are accepted.
  Precompute the bucket in the model and say in the description why it must be
  read rather than derived. This is the "precompute whatever the query dialect
  cannot express" rule that v2 of the build prompt dropped; it should go back.

### Masked terms - expect these tasks to fail, and report them separately

`High Resolution Scan` (KB 10) and `High Fidelity Mesh` (KB 13) are
`is_mask: true` in every task that uses them: the benchmark deliberately
withholds those thresholds so the agent must ask the user, and KB 12, 16, 19 and
53 depend on them. None ships. Tasks `archeology_scan_6`, `_M_1` and `_M_3` turn
on these terms and **cannot honestly be fixed in the model** - score them
separately rather than counting them as model defects.

**The rule is not "never ship a masked term".** A masked KB-NAMED FORMULA may
ship under its own name, because there the ambiguity is "which index did you
mean", which competing named metrics answer honestly. A masked THRESHOLD must
not, because baking in a cutoff answers the question. ESI, FEE and DPQ therefore
ship; KB 10 and 13 do not.

The operational test is the KB entry's own `type`, verified across three models:

| KB `type` | Masked terms | Shipped |
|---|---|---|
| `calculation_knowledge` (named formulas) | Effective Power Output, Annual Degradation Rate, Temperature-Corrected Performance, System Unavailability, Infrastructure Quality Score, Household Density, Bathroom Ratio | 7 of 7 |
| `domain_knowledge` (numeric cutoffs) | Underperforming Asset, Critical Alert, Severe Soiling Condition, Affluent / Crowded / Compact / Urban Household, Modern Dwelling, and 9 more | 0 of 17 |

The one apparent exception, `Accelerated Aging Asset`, is `domain_knowledge` whose
definition states no number, so nothing precise is handed over. The build prompt
now carries this `type`-based test so it is applied rather than re-decided per
model.

**Re-examined and upheld 2026-08-12.** The challenge was reasonable - a real
business semantic layer WOULD encode "High Fidelity Mesh", and the benchmark is
meant to test the layer more than the agent. Two things settled it. The rule is
not ours and not incidental: v2 of the build prompt states it directly, and its
change list records that it was STRENGTHENED off cybermarket evidence ("every one
of the four tasks that failed on every run of both backends turned on a masked
term, and no honest model change would have moved any of them"). And practice
matches the doc, per the table above.

**Measurement caveat worth repeating whenever a lift is quoted:** on a masked task
the raw arm must spend a turn asking, so a model that skipped that would be
banking a protocol artifact, not semantic-layer value.

**The exemption bar is that the DATA cannot express the concept, not that the
concept selects nothing.** KB 41 is exempt because the texture column never
carries 'Detailed' or 'Critical' and TDI peaks at 0.178 against a threshold of
8.0 - both conjuncts unreachable. KB 48 is exempt because all 8 sites reaching
DPQ > 80 already have ADC >= 70, so no project qualifies under either defensible
reading of "combined". KB 19, by contrast, IS shipped even though all 900 sites
come back 'No': its inputs are all present and in range, so an empty answer is a
real answer. `dryrun.py` asserts all five zeros live.

### Why the failing tasks fail - three causes, not seven

Every failing submission was replayed against gold offline and, where a
hypothesis needed testing, re-run live.

**1. Component averages use a support-set denominator; gold uses the population
(M-09).** The model's `Average <X>` measures average over the rows that HAVE an
X. Gold averages over every row in scope and treats a missing input as zero. The
two differ by exactly the coverage ratio, so any KB formula built on them is
wrong by that factor. Site SC3083: Average Surface Area 974.76 (over the 1 scan
that has one) vs gold's 487.38 (974.76 / 2 scans); PCDR 12.95 vs 25.89. The
numerator and density code agree to the last digit - only the denominator's row
count differs. Affects tasks 5 (582/900 sites differ), 9 (816/900) and, through
Model Fidelity Score, 6.

The STRUCTURE was already right: the `(Recomputed For Group)` calc correctly
divides aggregates rather than averaging per-row ratios. Switching to it does not
help, because its inputs carry the same denominators. The fix belongs in the
component measures.

**1b. But the denominator is not the scan count either - gold's joins fan out, and
that half must NOT be chased (B-17).** Correcting only the support-set denominator
reproduces gold on 201 of 243 usable sites and misses 42, because `arcref` is not
unique in any of these tables (up to 4 rows in `scans`, 3 in `pointcloud`, 2 in
`spatial`), so gold's join fans out and its denominator is the JOINED row count.
The two counts differ on 92 of 900 sites. Reproducing that would mean making a
`scans x pointcloud x spatial` cross product the fact grain, corrupting every
other measure to chase an artifact of a sloppy join. **Fix 1, log 1b as a gold
defect, accept task 9 as unwinnable.** Because grading is all-or-nothing, fixing 1
alone buys NO score on task 9 - do it for model correctness, not for lift.

**2. A site with no rows in a fact disappears when any measure from that fact is
projected (M-10).** The Site dimension has all 900 members and returns 900 alone,
but `SELECT "Site Code", "<any measure>"` returned 898. The two missing exist in
`sites` with a scan each but zero `environment` and zero `conservation` rows.
Sites that DO have fact rows with null contents still come back, so this is
specifically zero-fact-rows, not null-valued. Gold reaches all 900 by starting
`FROM sites` and LEFT JOINing.

Fixed 2026-08-11 by a spine: the `pairs` CTE became `real_pairs` plus a spine row
for every site present in none of them, carrying `equipref NULL` and
`spine_row_count 0`. The dataset goes 998 -> 1000 rows while still carrying 998
records, which is what keeps it inert - the record count is `sum(row_count)` and
stays 998, every `has_*_inputs` flag yields NULL on a spine row, and every measure
is an AVG. Verified live post-deploy: `Site + ESI` and `Site + MFS` return 900
where they returned 898, and every other count is unmoved.

**3. Task 1 threw away a won task on one column** (agent-side, mitigated). The
submission had the right 648 rows and values correct to 15 significant digits, and
scored 0 because `"Site Scan Quality Rank"` was in the SELECT purely so ORDER BY
could reference it. Dropping it and ordering by the SQS measure already projected
grades 1, verified live. A rank column is redundant with the measure it ranks, so
it never needs projecting. Now a rule in `config/environment_backends.yaml`.

**Task 2 - the grain IS reachable; the classification is not (M-11).** Gold's 926
rows are 455 conservation records plus the 471 sites that have none, and
`Conservation Record ID` expresses exactly that grain. The harder half: gold writes
`c.structstate <> 'Stable'`, but all three values in the data are sentences
('Stable condition, structure secure for access', ...), so nothing equals
`'Stable'` exactly and gold's predicate is TRUE for every record - its risk test
collapses to `Preservation Status IN ('Poor','Critical')`. The model's
`Degradation Risk Zone` uses `NOT LIKE '%Stable%'`, which is FALSE on the 142
stable-condition records; the two disagree on 142 of 455. **The model's reading is
the defensible one, so this must NOT be changed to match gold** - doing so would
require an agent to write a predicate contradicting the model's own attribute.

**Tasks 8 and 10 - unreachable.** Task 8: gold joins `processing` to `scans` on
SITE, not scan, taking 821 processing rows to 1102, and every per-group average is
over that fan-out. Same family as B-17. Task 10: gold's sixth column is the raw
`system_usage` jsonb projected whole, which no semantic-layer measure can return -
structurally not winnable at any model quality.

### Measurement, 2026-08-12 (n=1, 10 Query tasks, both arms)

**atscale 0.270 vs raw 0.100, lift +0.170.** Phase 1 3/10 against 1/10, phase 2
2/10 against 1/10. Won: `_3` and `_4` (1.00), `_1` (0.70); no raw wins.

**The lift does not depend on any deviation flag.** An offline replay of the same
submissions reproduces 2.70 under all four tie/decimal combinations, including
upstream (`tie=F dec=F`). Raw reproduced 0.100 exactly across two runs a day apart.

**Two earlier runs scored 0.000 and neither was a model result** - both were graded
by harness code held in memory since before B-19 and B-20 landed. The signature was
unambiguous once looked for: `_3` and `_4` graded FAIL live and PASS offline on
byte-identical SQL under identical flags. Tracked as B-23 and gated by
`scripts/gate_run.sh`, which refuses to run when the services predate the newest
harness commit. The Q-17b `list_models` gate does not catch this - it inspects the
catalog, not the code version - so both gates are needed.

Note what this says about re-grading: replaying recorded submissions answers "what
would the grader say about this SQL", never "what would the agent do next time".
The void run's own agent resubmitted identical SQL to budget -1 because the stale
grader kept telling it a correct answer was wrong.

### M-12 question-phrasing leakage removed, 2026-08-12

A cross-model scan found benchmark question wording copied verbatim into published
descriptions in all five BIRD models - archeology worst at 17 phrases across 4
tasks. The leaked text is question grammar rather than business vocabulary ("in
descending order of quality values"), and one DPQ description quoted a question
outright to steer the agent to itself. A model built for a real business would
contain none of it, so it inflates the arm on exactly the questions being measured.

Notably the leakage tracks the `DISCOVERY_PHRASES` build gate rather than the lift:
`solar_panel` carries the largest lift of any model (+0.370), predates that gate,
and has 2 phrases, while the two gate-built models carry the most. The gate as
inherited asks that every question wording match some published description, and
the cheapest way to satisfy it is to paste the question in.

**The governing rule: the model may describe WHAT A THING IS, never HOW A QUESTION
ASKS FOR IT.** Enforced by two build gates:

- **A8** - no published description may contain a verbatim 6-word run of any task
  question.
- **A9** - no `DISCOVERY_PHRASES` entry may be question-shaped: no question
  grammar, no 4-word run of a task question. An aggregation prefix over a real term
  is exempt, so `average Environmental Suitability Index` survives while `how many
  sites fall into each ECCS category` does not.

Plus an emit-time filter in `write()` stripping question-shaped synonyms from all
181 `Ask for it as:` lists - applied there rather than in `spec.py` so the policy
stays true for synonyms added later. Questions are read from the allowlisted brief
`extract_brief.py` emits, never from `bird_interact_data.jsonl`, so the answer-key
firewall stays auditable: a negative guard asserts absence rather than importing
content.

**Deployed, and it cost nothing: 0.270, identical to the leaky baseline** - same
three tasks pass, same per-task rewards. So the +0.170 lift stands on a model with
zero question-phrasing leakage. Of the four tasks carrying leaked phrasing, three
fail for structural reasons no phrasing could fix; only `_3` both leaked and
passes, and it passes either way.

Two cautions against over-reading. It is n=1, and the clean result is partly luck
of where the leakage sat on this database - concentrated on already-broken tasks.
It does NOT license leaving leakage in the other models: where a leaked phrase sits
on a winnable task the experiment would come out differently. What it establishes
is that removing leakage is cheap, so there is no reason to trade methodology for
score.

Verified live before re-running rather than trusting the deploy - an unpushed fix
deploys the old model and is indistinguishable from success.

### Read-the-submitted-SQL pass, 2026-08-12 (M-13 to M-16, Q-19)

Read what the agent actually submitted for every failing task, then fix the model
rather than the harness. Done against agent SQL, tool errors and the knowledge base
only - no gold SQL, so the answer-key firewall holds.

**The headline finding was wrong, and correcting it is the useful part.**
`archeology_scan_6` ended with ZERO submissions - five `explore_columns`, two
`ask_user`, no `run_query` - asking the user to define "High-Fidelity Mesh". Read
as a model gap, all six missing KB concepts (10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 53) were shipped.
That was a misreading of a decision this log and `SPEC.md` had already recorded:
those terms are `is_mask: true`, and task 6 spending its budget on `ask_user` is
the firewall working as designed. Baking the thresholds in would hand the atscale
arm an answer the raw arm has to ask for - the same teaching-to-the-test problem as
M-12, in a more damaging form. All six were reverted and redeployed before anything
ran against them.

KB 16 went too, and only the gate caught it. The reading was that the KB mentions
Premium Quality Scans as the *remedy* for a conservation priority, not a condition
of it - but the KB's own `children_knowledge` names KB 12 as a parent, so it
inherits the mask. **When the concept graph and a human reading disagree, the graph
wins.**

**Gate A10 now derives the firewall instead of trusting prose.** It reads `is_mask`
from the allowlisted brief, closes over the KB's own dependency edges, and fails
the build if any masked-or-dependent concept is implemented. It reproduces the
`SPEC.md` table exactly - firewalled `[10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 53]` - with masked named
formulas exempted through an explicit `MASKED_BUT_SHIPPABLE` list. A10's other half
requires every unmasked KB concept to be implemented or exemption-documented. The
lesson runs both ways: the mechanical gate caught a concept the hand audit missed
AND caught the hand audit shipping something it should not have.

**Three model defects visible only in the submitted SQL:**

- **M-14.** The Site Code description opened "USE THIS TO COUNT AND GROUP SITES" -
  grouping advice correct, counting advice not, since `COUNT(Site Code)` returns a
  list of site codes on this engine rather than a number, which is exactly what
  task 5 got back and believed.
- **M-15.** Neither `flowregistry` nor `facetregistry` was published, so a question
  wanting one row per processing run had no key but Equipment. Both are now
  attributes. (See the correction below - this premise did not hold up.)
- **M-16, a stale profile publishing wrong numbers.** `profile.json` recorded 998
  site-equipment records and 898 sites against a true 1000 and 900. Running the
  pre-change SQL from git HEAD returns 1000/900, so the profile was stale, not the
  SQL changed - a dozen deployed descriptions had been quoting 998. **Gate A11** now
  compares `profile.json` against `sqls.EXPECTED_ROWS` and fails the build on a
  mismatch; negative-tested, it reproduces this exact error. Note `profile_live.py`
  writes relative to cwd, so it must run from the generator directory.

Plus **Q-19**: `NTILE` rejected, so Environmental Suitability Quartile is now
precomputed (see Findings above).

**Net effect on the model surface: three attributes.** Metrics and calculations are
back at 94 / 10, exactly where they started; attributes 120 -> 123 (Environmental
Suitability Quartile, Processing Workflow ID, Mesh ID). Everything else is
corrected description text and KB annotations. A1-A11 pass, `dryrun.py` passes
including five unsatisfiability assertions, `sml-cli validate` clean, row counts
unchanged.

### Post-fix measurement and close-out, 2026-08-12

**0.270 atscale / 0.100 raw - unchanged.** Not one task moved. The three new
attributes bought nothing measurable on this task set.

- **Task 7 found and used `Environmental Suitability Quartile`** in its final
  submit, so Q-19's fix worked as intended; the failure is now downstream of it.
- **Task 10's premise was wrong (correcting M-15).** The question says "For each
  piece of equipment, please provide its ID" - equipment grain, and the ID already
  existed (`Equipment` is the registry code, 944 unique). The agent found it, used
  it, and correctly ignored the new workflow key. The remaining failure is a
  free-form JSON "resource details" column whose exact serialization is unknowable,
  plus an ambiguous row population. **Not a model defect.**
- The M-15 premise came from a single run's user-simulator wording ("from each
  individual processing instance"), which the next run contradicted ("for each
  equipment piece"). **Do not file a model defect off one run's simulator
  utterance** - require the task text or two runs.

**Where archeology stands.** Of 10 Query tasks: 2 won outright, 1 partial (`_1` at
0.70), 3 structurally closed (`_6` masked, `_8` and `_10` unreachable), and 4 lost
to gold defects deliberately not matched (`_2` M-11, `_5` M-09, `_7` float32,
`_9` B-17). The remaining model-side upside is `_1`'s phase 2 (0.30); everything
else open is engine, agent or grading. Treat 0.270 as this model's ceiling absent a
change in one of those layers.

### Fund attribute says how to count funds, 2026-08-12 (E-01)

The Fund level attribute's description now points at the `Fund Count` measure and
`COUNT(DISTINCT Fund)`, and states that plain `COUNT` over the attribute returns
ticker symbols rather than a number. `archeology_scan` has carried the equivalent
warning on Site Code since M-14; ETF carried nothing, which is the likely reason
ETF agents kept walking into E-01.

### M-12 question-phrasing leakage removed, 2026-08-12

Four phrases lifted verbatim from the evaluation questions, reworded out of six
files. Same policy as archeology.

| phrase | from | lived in |
|---|---|---|
| "the relationship between trading and skill" | `_8` | `alpha_turnover_slope` |
| "less sensitive to rate changes than category peers" | `_3` | `avg/max_duration_advantage`, `fund` |
| "'Total excess fees for all closet funds' sums this." | `_20` | `max/total_wasted_fee_amount`, `fund` |

Each was replaced with the quantity's own meaning rather than deleted - a
regression slope became "how much alpha changes per unit of turnover", the
duration gloss became "shorter duration than the category average". Seven lines
changed, no reformatting; `sml-cli validate` clean.

**The gate could not be ported as A8/A9.** ETF is a prompt-only build with no
`generator/`, so there is no `generate.py` to hold a build gate and no
`spec.DISCOVERY_PHRASES` for A9 to check - ETF carries zero "Ask for it as:" lists.
A9 is generator-only by construction. A8 was lifted into
`utilities/question_leakage_gate.py` in the models repo, which reads the published
YAML instead of the generator's in-memory objects and so covers prompt-only models
too. Cross-checked against archeology, where it agrees with generator A8. Questions
come from a firewalled `extract_brief.py` brief.

**Deployed 2026-08-12**, verified through the MCP layer rather than the repo: all
three old phrases absent from live descriptions, all three replacements present.

**Measured on the three affected tasks only** (n=1, $0.63): `_20` **1.00 -> 1.00**,
`_8` 0.00 -> 0.70, `_3` 0.00 -> 0.00. `_20` is the whole point of the check - the
only affected task that already passed, leaning on the descriptions that were
reworded. It held, so de-leaking ETF cost nothing, matching the archeology result.

`_8`'s gain is NOT de-leak credit - removing the model's help cannot add a win. The
baseline predates several harness guidance changes, so the run moved two variables,
and per-task swing is a full point on its own.

**This does not clear the ETF lift.** Only 3 of 19 tasks, one arm, n=1. Re-quote
only after a full both-arm run on the deployed model.

### Read-the-submitted-SQL pass, 2026-08-12

Read every submission for all 13 failing/partial ETF tasks (10 at 0.000, 3 at 0.700)
across the three most recent atscale runs, then probed each hypothesis live through
MCP at no LLM cost. Agent SQL, tool errors and the KB only — no gold SQL, so the
answer-key firewall holds. **Most of what the pass found is dialect, not model**, and
that is itself the finding: this model is in better shape than the harness's account
of how to query it was.

**One model change (M-18, an instance of M-02): `Fund Category Scored Fund Count`.** M-02
filed the general defect a year of runs ago — count measures ignore metric availability,
so a count paired with a metric disagrees with gold — and asked for an audit of every
count measure. This is that audit's first ETF result. KB 81 gates Category
Dominator on "the category contains at least 10 funds", and the model published only
one reading of that — `Category Fund Count` / `Fund Category Fund Count`, every fund in
the category. The second reading, funds the composite comparison can actually rank, was
not expressible at all: only 1142 of 2310 funds carry a Composite Score, and at a
cut-off of 10 the two readings qualify **49 categories against 34**. Task `_7` used the
only one on offer, three times, and failed all three. Shipped as a window count in
`fund_analytics` mirroring `Alpha-Turnover Pair Count`'s "sample size, not group size"
pattern, with both descriptions naming each other, quoting the 49-vs-34 divergence and
telling the agent to confirm which population the question means. Note what this does
NOT do: it does not pick the winning reading, it makes the ambiguity askable — which is
what the model owes a question the KB left open. `sml-cli validate` clean, A8 clean.

**Four harness-guidance defects, all read off submissions (see `config/environment_backends.yaml`).**

- **The sort-key error hint gave actively wrong advice.** It ended "the outer SELECT must
  not reference sortkey", conflating *ordering by* an unprojected column with *projecting*
  one. Task `_19` had the correct two-column result in `run_query`, then submitted the
  one-column version the hint described, then tried the two-column form using the
  measure's pre-alias name and died on "column reference does not exist in sub selects".
  A task lost to guidance, not to the engine.
- **Q-20 was uncovered entirely** — the four broken shapes for a total beside detail rows
  are now named alongside the one that works, with the warning that only one of them
  announces itself. This does NOT reopen B-04: gold for `_11` and `_12` appends a summary
  ROW with every value coerced to text, which no model query produces at all. What the
  guidance now adds there is that the silent empty result IS that attempt failing, and
  redirects to the FROM-less literal-values form rather than letting the agent read the
  empty result as an empty answer.
- **The grain rule was too weak.** It said to force the row grain in an inner derived
  table without saying the grain column must be in that table's SELECT LIST. Task `_14`
  wrote the derived table without it and got 0.013368 where the grain-forced value is
  0.013270 — no error, just a different number.
- **KB-walking is the largest single budget sink.** This model publishes each KB concept's
  full test inside the implementing column's own description (`KB '<name>': ...`), so one
  `explore_columns` returns the definition *and* the column. Task `_9` instead paid 29
  `get_knowledge_definition` calls — 14.5 of 24 coins — for definitions the model was
  giving away, and reached its first query broke. Guidance now says so.

Plus two free error hints for the tool responses that were costing coins with no repair
in them: `explore_columns`' "No columns matched" (14 of 90 calls across the three runs,
one task burning 6 coins on 6 empty searches) and the `Column [X] not found` family,
which covers both the invented-name case (`_8` phase 2 guessed "Fund Ticker") and the
inner-alias case.

**Checked and NOT changed, deliberately.** `Fund Turnover Ratio` and
`Fund Price Position in 52-Week Range` looked like unit bugs (`< 0.3` against a column
reaching 773.84; `< 25` against a 0-1-looking name) and are not — both descriptions
already state their scale and which KB threshold applies on it. Task `_14`'s measure and
a correctly grain-forced `AVG` agree to 15 digits, so `Average Consistency-Adjusted
Information Ratio` is not a denominator defect. Task `_10` needs a median the dialect
cannot compute (MDX-Median row) and the user simulator refuses to accept the mean twin;
that is an engine gap, not a model gap, and precomputing a median per grouping the
questions happen to use would be teaching to the test.

### Still leaking

Measured with the same gate: `cybermarket_pattern` 23 phrases over 6 tasks,
`households` 11 over 5. Both have generators and should get A8 wired in-build.
`solar_panel` could not be measured at all - `extract_brief.py`'s firewall audit
refuses it, because `solar_panel_16` asks the user to "group by the panel
technology" and the audit's `group\s+by` SQL-shape check fires on plain English.
That regex guards against gold leaking into a brief, so it was left alone;
narrowing it is a deliberate change to a firewall control. solar_panel is the
largest recorded lift (+0.370) and is currently ungatable.

## Grading-flag decisions

### Tie tolerance is off, and B-19 is why

`GRADING_TIE_TOLERANCE` forgives permutations of tied rows. It was introduced
because the semantic-layer arm returns an equally valid different tie order from
the one gold's own Postgres produced, so the flag looked asymmetric in the
semantic layer's favour.

**B-19 removed the cause rather than forgiving the symptom.** The semantic-layer
path now gives gold the same `remove_comments` -> `remove_distinct` ->
`remove_round` cleanup the raw path and upstream already give it. Unflagged,
because it retires a deviation rather than adding one.

The side effect matters more than the fix: stripping gold's `ROUND()` removes the
ARTIFICIAL ties it manufactured. Gold's `ORDER BY` was sorting on rounded values,
so its row order was arbitrary inside each tied block and no external engine could
reproduce it; unrounded, the order is strict and a full-precision semantic layer
matches it directly. `GRADING_TIE_TOLERANCE` is now a **no-op on the
semantic-layer arm** - identical pass counts either way on both domains
(archeology 5/21 submissions, ETF 17/74).

So the archeology lift no longer depends on a deviation flag, and the flag now only
affects the RAW arm - which makes keeping it on a choice that slightly favours raw
rather than one that rescues the semantic layer. **It stays off.**

### GRADING_REL_TOLERANCE stays off

`grading_rel_tolerance_value` was declared in config and read nowhere, so the 1e-6
default in `_values_close` was fixed regardless of the flag (B-20). The knob is now
wired; a declared-but-unread config value was a defect either way.

The flag itself stays **off**. Re-grading every archeology submission with it on:
no verdict changes on the atscale arm at all, and the RAW arm gains a task at the
default 1e-6. It helps raw, not the semantic layer.

### Why task 7 diverges, and why the model is NOT changed to match

Gold casts the JSON sensor fields to `real` (float32), then subtracts near-equal
magnitudes - `ABS(temp - 20)`, `ABS((hum - 50)/2)^1.5`. Cancellation amplifies
float32's ~1e-7 representation error into the 1.13e-5 measured against the live
model. The model casts the same fields to `::numeric`. That one choice is the
entire gap, and **the model is computing the MORE accurate value**.

Gold's convention is consistent enough to copy - every measure-like JSON field
`::real`, every count-like field `::bigint` - so the model could match bit-for-bit
with no grading deviation at all. Deliberately not doing it: nothing about the
source justifies float32 (it is JSON text, there is no upstream type to mirror, and
`double precision` would not close the gap - only `real` does), so choosing it is
gold-derived tuning, and it makes the model less accurate to win one task. Same
call as M-11.

Task 7 therefore joins B-17's family: lost to a defect in gold, logged rather than
worked around.

**What would reopen this.** If, with the full database set in, atscale submissions
start failing where a sub-1e-4 gap is the only thing between them and a pass, then
exact comparison is measuring the grader rather than the semantic layer, and that is
a good argument. `GRADING_AUDIT_PATH` makes counting it free and offline. Report it
as a sensitivity number next to the headline, never inside it.
